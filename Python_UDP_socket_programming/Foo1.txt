Assignement 1>>
udp socket prog
C           >             S (it create socket nad than u bind itand pass some packet)
(same)
put file_name(send)(c to s) > open and than send throught the socket.
get file_name
list 
exit




how to add reliability? 
add sequence no 
and send a duplicate packet as well with the same sequence no.
timers 
positive ack maybe
improve efficiency.... Stop n waitX, go back NY to decide NX, selective repest protocol .. gradually go on increasing the throughput to check the max capacity, (keep the pipe full to imporve eff) ( dont just snd only 1 packet at a time)
